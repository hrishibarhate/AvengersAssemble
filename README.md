# Problem Statement

Captain Fury has requested to make an application for the S.H.I.E.L.D to track the missions
assigned to each avenger. 

Currently, there are 6 avengers in the team, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. 
With time more superheroes can be added to the team. 

We need to create an application that can track the mission status
assigned to each avenger and can also assign a new mission to the avengers. 
So you are requested to create the interface for Captain Fury as of now.

As of now, Captain Fury can assign a maximum of two missions to any avenger at any point
in time, Captain can also update the mission status.

Avengers can check the mission details assigned to other avengers but cannot assign a new
task, but for now, we will create an app for captain fury only. 

But we need to keep in mind that at some point avengers will also be able to access the app with fewer privileges.

# Below is the expected behavior of the application:
● Captain Fury can check the status of all the avengers (if they are available to take any
mission or already on a mission)

● Captain Fury can also check the status of all the missions.

● Captain Fury can update the status of the mission. (Once mission is completed then
avengers should be available to pick the next mission)

● Captain Fury can check the details of any mission.

● Captain Fury can assign any mission to avengers. Max two missions can be assigned
to any avenger as of now.

● Captain Fury can assign an individual avenger to any mission. (But at any point max
two avengers should be assigned to any mission)

● Once the mission is assigned to any avenger, a notification will be sent to that
avenger by email/SMS/pager
